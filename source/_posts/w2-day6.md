This is the last day on the Reminder App sprint.  My partner and I spent many hours yesterday trying to figure out how to make the reminders to show up on the page. We were overwhelmed, exhausted and maybe a little dehydrated. After some discussions with the fellows and my husband, I think I have some ideas. Today will be better.

ES2015 (ES6) Highlights
--------------

* const (constant, immutable, all caps for variable name)
* let (bound to bracket scope, mutable, hoisted to the top of the bracket, use strict mode)
* Error function: bind this, don't use curly braces, 'return' not necessary
* Rest parameters: gather all args after declared parameters into an array. 
* Spread operators: concatenating arrays
* Default Value: creates 
* Maps: key/value storage but will not coerce the key to a string
* Sets: stores unpaired data (like an array) but without duplicates
* for...of loop
* destructing: quickly turning values from objects or arrays into variables
