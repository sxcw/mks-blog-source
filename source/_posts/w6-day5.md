Second last day before the junior phase is over. A lot of things not making any sense weeks ago gradually make sense to me now. Today, I got to play with a recipe api and then a brewery api. The recipe api has good reviews but it lacks a lot of information we would like to have. (because we are on a free basic plan)  The brewery api is awesome, and I did have a lot of fun playing with the data even though I don't drink at all and all the beer related terms sound alien to me.
