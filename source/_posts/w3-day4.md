I am almost half way through the junior phase. I am glad I made it here without getting sick or burnt out.  Students do a new project every 2 days and always feel I still do not fully understand the concepts and would like to spend more time on them... Well the intense nature of bootcamp makes it impossible. I hope those concepts will be more clear to me in the senior phase.
