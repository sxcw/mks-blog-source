I did a mock interview with Jamie today. He asked some technical and behavioral questions and provide feedback on my answers. In the end we did a simple toy problem and short Q&A. 

Below are the questions:

<h3>Technical</h3>
* What is Javascript closure?
* How is array different from stack? 

Many technical questions will include discussion of efficiency so I have to read more about big O. 

<h3>Behavioral</h3>
* What is my software engineering experience? 
* What is my role for my favorite project?
* What is the challenge you had with other teammate?

The key to answer questions is don't answer around. Every answer has to be to the point. 

<h3>White boarding</h3>
Jamie gave different toy problems and I happened to get an easier one.  After solving the toy problem, I should remember to discuss efficiency and ways to make it more efficient. It is also recommended that I throw in a few tests and see if the algorithm produce expected outputs. 

<h3>Q&A</h3>
* Always make sure I have time for Q&A, even if it is just 1 minute. Not asking any questions regarding the role or company plays against a candidate.
* Questions should focus on the company: What are the challenges the company is facing? How can I solve those problems? 
* Good questions for other developers: Can you walk me through your day yesterday? What do you like and don't like about this job? A few things you like and don't like about your managers? Is this a back filled or new role?
