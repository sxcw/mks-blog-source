8 days till code freeze and we still have a lot of issues on the board that need our attention.  Time flies and everyone looked a bit stressed out. 

I proposed an idea to my team this morning to ease the tension: for 10 minutes, every one of us can freely say whatever they have in mind-- it can be technical or non-technical.  I made sure everyone had a chance to speak.  Some of my teammates are not 'sharing type' and not used to expressing what they think out aloud in public but that's okay.  In this 10 minutes, no one would be judged, they can say very little or much, and they can say anything.

People are more productive and creative when they feel comfortable and safe.  Indeed, the 10-minute team bonding improves the team dynamics. Everyone looked more relaxed and I enjoyed the rest of my day more.
