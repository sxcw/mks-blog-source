More server side today.

Notes
-------------------

* `response.write()` ==> send multiple pieces of information
* CORS: cross-origin resource sharing: if we are on a domain,then our js cannot make requests to other domains 
* browser makes a `get` request (on the same domain, no need for cors); open the index.html directly (different domains) 
* buffer: expect things different than plain text
