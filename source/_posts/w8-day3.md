Data visualization and d3 today! I started using react-d3-componenet module last night and managed to have something show up! So exciting. The next step is populate graphs with meaningful users statistics.  This will be fun.  

CheckList
-----------

[Complete] Do 2 toy problems a day, one from senior challenge and one from junior challenge(for review).  
[Complete] Think about this journey as a marathon, not a short sprint. It's ok if I cannot get it the first time... just keep pushing.
[Not yet] Nice-to-have: Write better blog posts, document what I learn every day.

I am immersed with React-D3-Component today and will post what I am learned so far.
