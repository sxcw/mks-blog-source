This is second part of project reflections, and I want to share what I wish I could have done differently. Thesis project not only teach me how to code, it also teach me how to effectively work with other developers.  

<h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>

* I didn't communicate with my team often enough.  I was very immersed in working on a feature when I was almost done with it, I found out they expect me to do things in a different way.  My group ended up spending 2 hours making sure the code was consistent and nothing broke.  That was not a difficult fix but it did take some time.  The problem could be avoided if I checked in with my group more often. 

* I didn't want to delete my old code. I felt too attached to it.  I should have pivoted earlier if things don't work out in a few hours. I ended up spending a few days on a third party library that did not help me deliver more and faster.
