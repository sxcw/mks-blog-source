Feeling very fatigued. A power nap and green tea don't really help.  After 20 days of intensive learning and coding, my body is yelling at me for a break. It's funny that I still want to look at code even though my body doesn't want to cooperate. Time to slow down and take a deep breath. I will be sharp and ready very soon. 


Notes
-------------------

* Process: is like a living organism. My CPU is shared among all the processes
* Client -> [request] -> Server
* Routing (handling different endpoints)
* background job: a process that doesn't have a user interface (process with no UI). No user input is needed.
* Daemon: A program designed to run in the background
*  Cron: Process scheduler. Cron job: this program scheduled to run every so often
* File I/O: when we read/ write a file, that's file input/output
