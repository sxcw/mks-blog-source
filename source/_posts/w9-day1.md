Software Development Methodology: How do we develop things?

<h4> Waterfall (traditional): </h4>
* Going downstream, hand project to the next person
* cost of change is too high, resistant to change 
* deliver nothing until you deliver it all
* process: discover --> design --> develop --> test

<h4> Agile: </h4>
* doing the same type of process but shorter time frame, iterative
* deliver values quickly
* constantly collect feedback

<h4> Daily 15-min standup: </h4>
* What did I do? 
* What I am doing today? 
* Do I have any blocker? (lack of understanding)

<h4> Sprint retrospective meeting: </h4>
* Going well 
* Going bad
* Not sure
