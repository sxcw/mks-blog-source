I rewrote the tests for the form component using enzyme. Enzyme is similar to React Test Utils but it allows me to write more concise code.  Right now I am just using shallow rendering to check if the form renders correctly and if the buttons behave as expected (if button click triggers the appropriate function). It has been fun.
