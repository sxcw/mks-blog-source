More D3 today!

CheckList
-----------

[] Do 2 toy problems a day, one from senior challenge and one from junior challenge(for review).  
[] Think about this journey as a marathon, not a short sprint. It's ok if I cannot get it the first time... just keep pushing.
[] Nice-to-have: Write better blog posts, document what I learn every day.
