Today I had my one-on-one white boarding session with Jamie. He went through the things to pay attention to when we do white boarding and then asked me to solve a very simple toy problem on the white board.  The point of the one on one is to provide feedback on my white boarding skills: did I communicate well, engage with the interviewers, and strategically use the limited space on white board? 

Jamie also showed me 4 steps in solving problems on white board:

1. understand the problem: ask more questions, make sure I know the constraints
2. talk about a simple solution: in a few sentences, talk about how I am going to attack the problem, I can ask interviewers if I am on the right track
3. pseudo-code
4. code
