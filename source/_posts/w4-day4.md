<h3> Quick Reflection: What I have learned besides coding at MKS? </h3>

1) Better time management: focus on what is essential
2) Prioritize learning: So many things to learn, and so little time, I have to pick the ones that I absolutely have to master
3) Staying positive: A lot of things can keep me feel small. Positive self-talk boosts my confidence and redirects me to the right track.



























Notes
-------------------

* Process: is like a living organism. My CPU is shared among all the processes
* Client -> [request] -> Server
* Routing (handling differnet endpoints)
* background job: a process that doesn't have a user interface (process with no UI). No user input is needed.
* Daemon: A program designed to run in the background
*  Cron: Process scheduler. Cron job: this program scheduled to run every so often
* File I/O: when we read/ write a file, that's file input/output
