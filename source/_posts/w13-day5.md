I cannot believe I've made it this far. During the 3 months of intensive coding, I've learned so many skills, made many friends who enjoy coding as much as I do and built 3 portfolio ready projects that I am proud of.  There were some furstrating moments when I feel 'I don't belong here, I cannot do this' and some exciting moments when I feel coding is one of the most wonderful things in the world.  

I also learned to deal with Imposter Symdrome.  Every time when I start to fall down the rabbit hole of feeling small, weak, worthless, I close my eyes and take a deep breath, tell myself firmly: 'You have everything it takes to accomplish this, you can do it'. Taking a piece of paper, I then write down the task I need to do and start breaking it down to managable chunks. I am a visual person so drawing dragrams helps.  Panic usually magically goes away when I have an clear attack plan and know my next step.

The end of MakerSquare is the the beginning of holding myself accountable to my goals . I should use the skills I possess to make creative, intuitive and useful products, things that help people learn better and do tasks more efficiently.  I should be grateful for what I have become and give back to the community when I can.  Share what I know and mentor those who are junior than me.  

Okay, we have a plan, let's begin another journey. It will be rewarding and fun.
