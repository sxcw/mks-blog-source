Survived 1 month in intensive coding bootcamp! Achievement unlocked! 
I didn't expect myself being able to make it this far without getting burned out.  July is the transition phase, I will go from a junior to senior after the solo week. After solo week, I will be thrown into projects after projects.  More autonomy and accountability.



Notes
-------------------
* Time complexity for insertion sort: n2, merge sort: n log n
* Angular: the names of perimeter change the behavior of the code. Almost like requiring a module. The perimeter names in different functions have to match up so Angular can feed the functions correctly
* SPA: navigate around without reload the page
* Three way to create client side routing: 
 1. Hash- changing routes: implement route by adding `#` 
 2. HTML 5 pushstate routes: CHANGE THE REAL URL WITHOUT FULL PAGE REFRESH
 3.query string routes 
* `ng-model = 'user.password'` : if data does not exist, it will not throw an error -- it will swallow it 
* `$`: built into Angular, it means angular- specific thing
