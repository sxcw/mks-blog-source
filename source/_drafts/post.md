Bootcamp will start tomorrow at 9am.  I am excited and scared at the same time. Excited because it's the start of something new, something so significant that it's life-changing. Excited that I will eventually be equipped with the technical skills to make my side projects come true. Scared because I am not sure how it will go. So many self doubts pop into my head: Will I do well? Will I keep up with the class? What if I am left behind? Funny that I am not worried about finding a job or not at all, I am more concerned with 'being the last one in class' or 'becoming a burden during pair programming'.  

Those self doubts definitely keep pushing me forward. The fear of being left behind has made sure I finish assignments way before the deadlines.  But immersing myself in self doubts for too long is unhealthy and destructive. One day, I might be convinced that everyone around me is smarter, quicker and maybe ... __better__? 

STOP.  It's time to read <a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5#.3r3pu0gp7" target="_blank"> Overcoming Impostor Syndrome </a>.
