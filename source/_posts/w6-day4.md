Today marks the first day of project phase. The first group project is called 'greenfield project'. We are free to decide on what app we want to make and what stacks we want to use.  My group came up with a good app idea with reasonable scope. We also went over the git workflow and styles guide everyone should follow.  Tomorrow we will iron out the species -- who will do what before the first check-in next Tuesday.
