Goodbye junior phase! Dozens of sprints and super intensive learning. It has been challenging, exhausting and fun.  
The cumulative assessment isn't as scary as I thought. I was given the entire Saturday to finish 4 exercises -- data structures, front-end SPA frameworks, node/express/database and building a mini api. I was stuck in the file reading function and couldn't pass all the tests. Even though I didn't finish up that challenge, I wrote meaningful comments making sure the code reviewers would know my logics/intentions. 

Now comes the solo week. Learn some and rest some.
