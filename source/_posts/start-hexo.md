Finally, finally, my Hexo blog is ready! For the past weeks, I started to notice a problem: as the number of blog entries grow, it becomes hard to manage my `index.html` (yes, I used to put every entry in that file).  Imagine having 100+ blog entries, the `index.html` will be super long.  

So I started the search for a easy, light-weight blogging platform and <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank"> Hexo </a> came to my rescue.  Comparing to Wordpress, Hexo is very light-weight and because it is a static blogging framework so I can host my blog almost everywhere. 

Hexo provides quite a few quality <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/" target="_blank"> themes </a> for you to use. My favorite is <a href="https://github.com/lotabout/very-simple" target="_blank"> very-simple </a>.  When I saw the timeline feature, I knew: this is it! this is what I want! I downloaded the theme and then spent a few hours tweaking it to my liking. 

Deploying blog to github pages is easy (Hexo's one-command deployment makes the process painless). The part that tripped me up is to make sure the pathes are correct and github pages knows where to get my CSS. Inspecting the pathes in google developer's tool turns out to be very helpful. Pointing me in the right direction. 

Okay, enough for Hexo now, I should go back to review MKS prework content, especially underbar and recursion. 3 days left, mixed feelings.
