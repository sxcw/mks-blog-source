One thing great about front-end development for me is the chance to try out   libraries and frameworks. When the documentation is complete and up-to-date, playing with new features is thrilling; if the documentation does not give much useful information, then the experience would not be too pleasant.  After juggling with Redux Form for a few days, I decided to pivot -- refactored the redux form to plain React form, no third party library. This meant I needed to write the reducers and form validation myself but it saved me a lot of time on trouble-shooting all the warnings/errors React threw at me. Plus, I now have complete control over the form.
