This is the last day on the Reminder App sprint.  My partner and I spent many hours yesterday trying to figure out how to make the reminders to show up on the page. We were overwhelmed, exhausted and maybe a little dehydrated. After some discussions with the fellows and my husband, I think I have some ideas. Today will be better.
