After a restful solo week, I am offically a senior today. Things get harder and more exciting now.  For the following 5 weeks (up till the careeer week), a couple of things I want to do:

* Do 2 toy problems a day, one from senior challenge and one from junior challenge(for review). 
* Think about this journey as a marathon, not a short sprint. It's ok if I cannot get it the first time... just keep pushing.
* Nice-to-have: Write better blog posts, document what I learn every day.
