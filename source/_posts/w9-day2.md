Today is the first day of thesis project, which is going to span over 4 weeks.  In the next few weeks, I will document what our team has one and the problem we are facing (and of course, how we fix the problems). 


Idea Formation 
-----------

We spent hours brainstorming ideas and finally decided on doing 'Pulse' (name is subject to change). 'Pulse' is a web app that enables people to set up or search for last-minute events.  Some of the use cases would be: I am looking for a person to play tennis with me later this afternoon, or I want to check if there are any events around me the next 20 minutes.  

Okay, user backlog on Pulse:

**Users:**  People who want to set up event or go to events
**Vision:** To quickly find and set up dynamic events near you. Finding a group of people for a last minute activity can be very hard, and this is the problem the app is going to solve.
**Design:** Mobile first design. The majority of users will probably be posting/checking events on the go. 

After filling in the details, everyone in our group is pretty excited about the project. That's a good sign.
