Mobile responsive:  I use mobile first design, and start CSS styling for the smaller screens such as mobile phones.  The limited horizontal space makes sure I only show the essential information to users.  Once our website looks good on smaller screens, I rearrange the content to better fit in bigger screens like tablets and desktops.
