I spent some time working on the styles last night, and the mini web app is finished. It is very basic and doesn't have much functionality. But I think it's pleasant to look at.  :) 

This full-stack project turns out to be very helpful. I learned how to make a full-stack app and gained a deeper understanding of the interaction between client and server sides.  Database is not so scary now.  I will figure out how to deploy the mini app to Heroku later. For now, let's enjoy the screenshot of my app. 

I also found out the pagination links in this blog don't work. I dug into the yml file and fix the broken links. Yay.
