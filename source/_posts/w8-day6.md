Today I examined my old resume and drafted a new resume that is targeted at web development jobs. 

CheckList
-----------

[Not Yet] Do 2 toy problems a day, one from senior challenge and one from junior challenge(for review).  
[Complete] Think about this journey as a marathon, not a short sprint. It's ok if I cannot get it the first time... just keep pushing.
[Complete] Nice-to-have: Write better blog posts, document what I learn every day.


Resume
---------
* First Rule of Job Search: Never say/write anything unless it positively supports your posistion as an applicant
* More to your portfolio: LinkedIn, Github, Cover Letters, Angelist
* Resume is controlling the narrative: think from reader's perspective
* Strong resumes: experience with relevant skills, depth of relevant experience, non-tech professinoal experience, history of success, and personal
* General flow: Header -> Skills -> Projects -> Prof Experience -> Education -> Personal
* Header(3-4 lines max): Email, Github, LinkedIn, blog, add city
* Skills: Strong, experienced lists
* Projects: what did I build? role? key tech used? [20-30%]
* Experience: includes accomplishments, outcomes, and impact. Not Tasks. Qualify, Quantify scope, quantify impact.  Numbers draw attention! 
1. Start with action verbs, no 'responsible for'
2. State years, not months
3. 3-4 bullet points
4. Avoid hanging lines
* Education: Makersquare as'advanced software engineering immersive' 
* Personal: 2-3 line max with interests and fascinating facts about you.
