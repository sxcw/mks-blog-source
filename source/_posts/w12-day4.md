One of my teammates proposed to remove the 'no duration limit' check-box because it did not make sense to him that users can create an event without a set duration.  For me, that feature provides useful flexibility. Users might not know the duration of an event and they should not be forced to select anything they are not sure. 

After some discussion with the entire team, we decided to remove the feature because 1) our back-end has not supported no duration events and 2) we have not implemented a mechanism for users to cancel events and we certainly do not want event page to be clogged up with events with infinite duration. Well, these two reasons are legit an I agreed to remove my beloved feature. This is the nature of any group project: we sometimes have to compromise on parts of the project so that the product can work as expected by deadlines.
