As the final presentation day gets closer, I can find stress and exhaustation on a lot of people's faces. All of us have been working on projects 12 hours a day for 3 weeks and desperately need a break.  

Exhaustation hit me this morning. I was like a zombie.  I am looking forward to my cruise trip after the bootcamp.  I need to get away from this intense schedule for a while.  But I am also a little bit scared because what comes next is job searching and uncertainties. 

I will be fine and I made sure I tell my classmates: 'You will be fine.'
