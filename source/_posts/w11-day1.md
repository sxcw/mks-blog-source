3rd week into the thesis project. It's time to reflect on what went well, what I've learned, and the things I wish I could have done differently (tomorrow's post).

<h3>What Went Well</h3>

* I got better at React and Redux.  The Redux life cycle, which was fuzzy for me becomes more intuitive.  I learn to appreciate the beauty of Redux.  All the essential information is in store and readily available to components. Using Redux state makes my code in components more readable. 

* I got better at git, especially rebasing. Rebasing was painful and time-consuming at first, and I was overwhelmed by the conflicts git threw at me.  As I got better at reading other people's code and making meaningful commits, rebasing becomes less intimidating. 

* I got better at prioritizing tasks.  My group has tons of features we want to do but by the end of the day, we know we are not going to finish them. We need to be realistic. We learn to pick and focus on the features that bring the most value and also fit in our project scope.
