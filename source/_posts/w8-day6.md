Today I examined my old resume and drafted a new resume that is targeted at web development jobs. 


Resume
---------
* First Rule of Job Search: Never say/write anything unless it positively supports your position as an applicant
* More to your portfolio: LinkedIn, Github, Cover Letters, Angelist
* Resume is controlling the narrative: think from reader's perspective
* Strong resumes: experience with relevant skills, depth of relevant experience, non-tech professional experience, history of success, and personal
* General flow: Header -> Skills -> Projects -> Prof Experience -> Education -> Personal
* Header(3-4 lines max): Email, Github, LinkedIn, blog, add city
* Skills: Strong, experienced lists
* Projects: what did I build? role? key tech used? [20-30%]
* Experience: includes accomplishments, outcomes, and impact. Not Tasks. Qualify, Quantify scope, quantify impact.  Numbers draw attention! 
1. Start with action verbs, no 'responsible for'
2. State years, not months
3. 3-4 bullet points
4. Avoid hanging lines
* Education: Makersquare as 'advanced software engineering immersive' 
* Personal: 2-3 line max with interests and fascinating facts about you.
