For this sprint, I am going to implement a reminder web app.  It will have the following functionalities: login, a dashboard where users can add, update, delete reminders. Users can also filter their reminders.

I am also going to delve a little deeper into the server side, using Promises instead of callback to solve asynchronous problems.
