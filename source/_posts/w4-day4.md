<h3> Quick Reflection: What I have learned besides coding at MKS? </h3>

1) Better time management: focus on what is essential
2) Prioritize learning: So many things to learn, and so little time, I have to pick the ones that I absolutely have to master
3) Staying positive: A lot of things can keep me feel small. Positive self-talk boosts my confidence and redirects me to the right track.
