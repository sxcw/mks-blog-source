Last day of week 5.

Notes 
-------------------
* The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component. When a component's state changes, render is called with the new state and the UI is updated to the new output. (<a href="http://buildwithreact.com/" target="_blank">Build with React</a>)
* Functional component: it doesn't have any concept of states <--> class based component
* `brew services start mongodb`:  if mongodb service is not running on the mac
