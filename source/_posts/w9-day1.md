CheckList
-----------

[Not Yet] Do 2 toy problems a day, one from senior challenge and one from junior challenge(for review).  
[Complete] Think about this journey as a marathon, not a short sprint. It's ok if I cannot get it the first time... just keep pushing.
[Complete] Nice-to-have: Write better blog posts, document what I learn every day.
