Today is the first day of career week. We have some lectures on how to write cover letters and establish online presence. 

* Rule #1: Never say/write anything unless it positively supports your position as an applicant
* Ways that undermines myself: failing to send a cover letter, not explaining why you're an ideal candidate, not showing interest in the company
* Personal narrative: a short, appealing story, like an elevator pitch.
* Mistake #1: Not using social media to augment job search
* During whiteboarding: try over-communicate
* Conversion rate: Every 100 applications, 20 phones, 10 on-site interviews, 2 offers
* Go to Meetups: elevator pitch polished and ready to go, ask for contact info, connect with folks on LinkedIn, ask people to coffee
* Phone screen: cultural fit, speak their language, smile, sound enthusiastically 
* Follow up on Rejections 
* Mastermind meeting: weekly group meeting last 30 mins, entire group offers feedback and support
