<h3>Helpful Tip</h3>
* Components to an interview: 1) the fear of loss is greater motivator than the possibility of gain. People usually choose their easiest option 2) create the rapport during on-site:  Make them like you, talk about anything but code, search for commonalities. Look at interviewer's LinkedIn, and find things you two have in common
