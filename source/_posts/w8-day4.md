I have used <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank"> pgAdmin3 </a> for a while and the experience is OK. I was introduced to another GUI called <a href="https://eggerapps.at/pgcommander/" target="_blank"> postgres commander </a> and I like it immediately. The interface is cleaner and easier to use. 

To create a table, click on SQL terminal and type in `create table YOUR_TABLE_NAME`, hit command + enter to create the table. (eg. `create table test()`).  Dropping tables is easy, type in `drop table YOUR_TABLE_NAME` and you are done!  Remember to hit command + R to refresh the page.
